Hi everyone, my name is Richard McCoy!
I'm currently a senior physics major at Hamilton College ('23).
I have coding experience with Python and am currently learning C++ and R.
I have work experience with Amentum Services as a TEAM SUB logistics engineer at the WNY.
I'll be starting as a physicist at NSWCCD (Carderock) in Code 775 in the summer of 2023.
